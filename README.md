# Special '.snirf' Files

## Description
This repository contains code and resources for working with special '.snirf' files. 

## What Are '.snirf' Files?
'SNIRF' stands for Standardized Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Data Format. These files are commonly used in functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) research. fNIRS is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that measures changes in blood oxygenation in the brain by sending near-infrared light through the scalp. '.snirf' files are used to store and manage fNIRS data, making them a crucial component of fNIRS research.

## Applications in fNIRS
- **Data Storage:** '.snirf' files are used to store raw fNIRS data, including information on light sources, detectors, and the recorded signals.
- **Data Sharing:** Researchers use '.snirf' files to share fNIRS data, ensuring data consistency and compatibility across different software and platforms.
- **Analysis:** The standardized format of '.snirf' files simplifies data analysis, as multiple software packages support this format, allowing researchers to process and analyze fNIRS data efficiently.
- **Meta-Analysis:** Researchers and the broader scientific community can use '.snirf' files to conduct meta-analyses, combining data from multiple studies to draw broader conclusions.

# 'mne' Module

## Description
This repository includes code and tools for working with the 'mne' module.

## What Is the 'mne' Module?
The 'mne' module, short for MNE-Python, is a powerful open-source software for working with electrophysiological and neuroimaging data, including Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG). It provides a comprehensive set of functions for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.

## Applications of the 'mne' Module
- **Neuroimaging Data Processing:** The 'mne' module is used to preprocess and analyze MEG and EEG data, which are essential for studying brain function and understanding neural activity.
- **Source Localization:** Researchers can apply the 'mne' module to estimate the sources of brain activity, helping identify the regions responsible for specific cognitive functions.
- **Functional Connectivity Analysis:** It allows for the investigation of how different regions of the brain communicate and synchronize their activities.
- **Brain Imaging Visualization:** The 'mne' module provides tools to create visualizations and brain maps, aiding in the interpretation of neuroimaging results.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Researchers use 'mne' for statistical analysis to draw conclusions and infer relationships between neural activity and behavioral or cognitive processes.
